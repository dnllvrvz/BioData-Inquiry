# BioData-Exploration

This repository holds the documentation of the BioData Exploration with arduino. Code and data samples are provided in the respective folders, as well as gadgets concepts and designs.

## Arduino Setup

Here's a picture of the initial circuit (V0.0) used for the collection of the first data samples in this exploration. It has been inspired by [this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ogMm94AH80) by Build It.

The only difference between this drawing and the actual setup that I have been using is that I have an Arduino Uno, instead of an Arduino Nano. But for the purpose of this project that doesn't change anything. You can use any arduino board.

Here's a playlist where I explain the setup and show examples of its functioning: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgduvfqJa2lOS8xUoFPziR5fBI0N4Owao

The Exploration keeps on developing, and so new code and samples are progressively added to this repo.
